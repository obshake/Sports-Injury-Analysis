# Sport Injury Analysis Dashboard
This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard for analyzing sports injuries. Built with a focus on clear, actionable insights, the dashboard helps users explore key trends in athletic injuries, recovery times, and treatment costs.

## Features
  * **Comprehensive Data Overview:** Instantly view total injuries, average recovery days, and overall treatment costs.
  
  * **Injury Type and Location Analysis:** Drill down into specific injury types (e.g., fractures, muscle strains) and affected body parts.
  
  * **Demographic Breakdown:** Analyze injury data by age group and gender to understand specific risk factors.
  
  * **Competition Level Insights:** Compare injury rates and types between professional and amateur athletes.
  
  * **Recovery and Treatment Effectiveness:** Visualize average recovery days for different injury types and assess the effectiveness of various treatment methods.
  
  * **Interactive Filters:** Use a variety of filters to customize the data view based on gender, competition level, sport, and injury severity.

## Key Insights
  * Of the injured, almost 80% were fully recovered, while a small percentage retired or recovered with limitations.
  
  * Females experienced a higher number of injuries than males.
  
  * Amateur competitions led to more injuries than professional events.
  
  * Fractures were the most frequent injury type.
  
  * Indoor courts had the highest injury counts.
  
  * Females aged 31â€“35 showed a higher incidence of injuries.
  
  * Achilles and rib injuries had the longest average recovery times.
